# pandas-challenge (Module 4 Challenge)

5/21 
Started with PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb
Short study group with Eva, Tracy and Tahseen - just talked about some logistics and moral support

For District Summary: count unique schools: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-count-distinct-values-of-a-pandas-dataframe-column/
to get unique budget first made a new dataframe with just the schools
https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-create-new-dataframe-by-selecting-specific-columns/
then deleted duplicates followed by summing the budget

For School Summary
Note: the first input stated to “use the code provided…” but there was no code so used .unique()
